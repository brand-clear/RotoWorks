# RotoWorks

### Overview
RotoWorks is a desktop application that guides users through as-received inspections of used mechanical systems. 

### Dependencies
To get the most out of this application users should have Innovmetric's PolyWorks Inspector and Autodesk's AutoCAD installed on their local machine. Additionally, a portable CMM device (e.g. Faro Arm) is required to collect the measurements.

### Inspection
Each feature is recorded twice with a portable CMM device. RotoWorks will apply its own internal metrics for measurement validation. If deemed invalid the user is prompted with an explanation and may choose to remeasure or cancel the operation.

### Documentation
After all dimensional data is collected and exported the user may auto-populate the inspection results in AutoCAD as long as an approved DWG file is open.
